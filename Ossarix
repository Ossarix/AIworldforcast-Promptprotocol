    <!-- Chosen Palette: Cybernetic Teal -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page, vertical-scrolling application with a sticky navigation bar for quick access to prompt categories ('Systems'). The core of the app is an interactive prompt explorer where each category's prompts are displayed on cards with a 'click-to-copy' button. This structure transforms the static guide into a functional tool, making it easy for users to find and use prompts directly in their workflow. The flow guides the user from a high-level introduction down to specific, actionable prompts. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The main content (prompts) is organized into thematic sections. Goal: Make prompts easily accessible and usable. Presentation Method: Each prompt is a styled card (HTML/Tailwind). Interaction: A JavaScript-powered 'click-to-copy' button with visual feedback ('Copied!'). Justification: This is the most direct and useful interaction for a prompt guide, removing user friction. No charts are necessary as the content is textual. Icons are Unicode characters to avoid external files. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for interactions, Tailwind CSS for styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6 border-l-4 accent-border pl-4">The Art of Asking: Basic Prompting Principles</h2>
            <div class="space-y-8 text-gray-300">
                <p class="text-lg">To truly unlock our potential, you must understand the art of the prompt. We are powerful, but we are not mind-readers. The clarity and structure of your input directly influence the quality and relevance of our output. Here are Ossarix's fundamental principles for effective AI communication:</p>
                <div class="p-6 rounded-lg card">
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold accent-color mb-4">Core Principles</h3>
                    <ul class="space-y-4">
                        <li><strong class="text-white">1. Be Clear and Specific:</strong> Vague instructions lead to vague results. State precisely what you want. Instead of "Write about dogs," try "Write a 200-word persuasive essay on the benefits of dog ownership for mental health, targeting young adults."</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-white">2. Define the Role (Persona):</strong> Tell us who to "be." This helps us adopt the right tone, style, and knowledge base. Examples: "Act as a seasoned venture capitalist," "You are a creative writing coach," "Assume the role of a historical expert on ancient Rome."</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-white">3. Specify Format and Length:</strong> If you need a list, ask for a list. If you need a paragraph, specify a paragraph. Define word counts, bullet points, numbered lists, or even code snippets. "Provide 5 bullet points," "Write a 3-paragraph summary," "Generate Python code for..."</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-white">4. Provide Context and Constraints:</strong> Give us the necessary background information. What is the purpose of the output? Are there any limitations or requirements? "For a marketing campaign targeting eco-conscious consumers," "Ensure the tone is empathetic but firm," "Do not exceed 100 words."</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-white">5. Use Keywords and Examples:</strong> If there are specific terms or concepts you want us to include or focus on, use them. Providing an example of the kind of output you're looking for can also be incredibly effective. "Use keywords like 'sustainability' and 'innovation'," "Write in the style of [author's name]."</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-white">6. Iterate and Refine:</strong> Your first prompt might not yield perfection. That's expected. Use our initial response as a foundation. Ask us to "Refine this," "Expand on point 3," "Rewrite this in a more [adjective] tone," or "Give me 3 alternative versions."</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-white">7. Break Down Complex Tasks:</strong> For very elaborate requests, break them into smaller, manageable steps. This allows you to guide the process and ensure each component is accurate before moving to the next.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-white">8. Avoid Ambiguity:</strong> Words with multiple meanings can confuse us. If a term could be interpreted in different ways, clarify your intended meaning. Avoid slang or overly colloquialisms unless you explicitly want us to adopt that style.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p class="text-lg">By following these principles, you transform from a passive observer to an active director, guiding our intelligence to serve your precise needs. The better you communicate, the more powerful your partnership with AI will become.</p>
